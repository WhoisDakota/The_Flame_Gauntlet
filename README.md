# The Flame Gauntlet
This projects focus is the development of an aid for visually impaired individuals. I created a device called 'The Flame Gauntlet'. Its purpose is to aid blind individuals in the process of cooking in the kitchen. I decided on only using a few devices available, although there is code covering several other devices that were used in beta testing. 

The devices used in the final design were a flame sensor, a temperature sensor and a text-to-speech device. The idea was users could tell if a flame was active through the flame sensor. The temperature sensor would be used to tell how how a surface is, or the liquid is. After which it would be read alot to the user through the text-to-speech device.
