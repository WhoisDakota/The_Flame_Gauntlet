# The Flame Gauntlet
This projects focus is the development of an aid for visually impaired individuals. I created a device called 'The Flame Gauntlet'. Its purpose is to aid blind individuals in the process of cooking in the kitchen. I decided on only using a few devices available, although there is code covering several other devices that were used in beta testing.
